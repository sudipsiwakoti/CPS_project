$engineeringDesc = "This program is a comprehensive preparation for careers in the professional practice of engineering. Students learn to deal with complex systems and manage large-scale projects using the most appropriate emerging technologies.

The course offers an authentic, professionally focused and practice-based education program with two sessions of internship (normally paid) in a real workplace setting. A number of the areas of study are available with explicit specialisations. For example, Civil Engineering is available with specialisations in Structures and Construction. Students can also focus on or broaden their studies by completing electives. By appropriate choice of electives, students can gain knowledge in a second engineering discipline, obtain a sub-major in a different field or study postgraduate-level subjects and apply for credit towards an engineering master's degree. The concept has been strongly endorsed in wide-ranging industry consultations. Interaction between work experience and academic curriculum is very strong, giving the program a depth that no other full-time academic course can match.";

$artsDesc = 'Students who originally enrolled in the Bachelor of Education in Primary Education (C10206), Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Education (C10350) or Master of Teaching in Secondary Education (C04255) have the opportunity of transferring to this three-year degree (subject to the approval of the program director). This degree does not provide qualifications to teach.

The skills and knowledge about education delivered in this course are relevant in a wide range of professions. Students gain a foundational knowledge about education and explore avenues for building on this knowledge in their future careers.';

$healthSciDesc = "This course provides the opportunity for eligible graduates of the Bachelor of Health Science (C10360) to extend their skills and understanding of the research process. It emphasises the reciprocal relationship between health research and the contexts of local and global health.

This course provides Bachelor of Health Science graduates with the opportunity to develop skills in clinically focused research. The course deepens students' understanding of the importance of research in health.

The course places health science research within the professional, philosophical, historical, social, cultural and political contexts of health. The honours program is regarded as a research apprenticeship and requires an extensive commitment from students. It is an opportunity to produce a substantial piece of work, conduct research and/or explore research data in an area of interest at much more depth and more independently than has been possible in previous undergraduate studies.";

$compSciDesc = 'This course offers a sound education in all aspects of computing science and information technology. It is intended for students who aspire to become researchers or who want a career in a more scientific-oriented computing area. As such it provides a pathway to postgraduate research study.

This course adopts a practice-based approach to computing science education and the course content is a mix of theory and practice, with a stronger focus on the mathematics appropriate for computing science and research projects. As well as gaining strong technical skills in computing science and IT, students gain skills in problem-solving, teamwork and communication. Students undertake research projects with UTS researchers. Employers look for graduates with strong computing science skills and, in this course, students are exposed to real research problems in computing science and IT.

UTS: Information Technology continues to support part-time study and some subjects can be taken in the evening as well as during the day.';

$infoSystemsDesc = 'The Bachelor of Information Systems Bachelor of Business (BIS BBus) is a cross-faculty offering, leveraging the strengths of Information Systems and Business. The offering is aimed at meeting the emerging demands of a new generation of technology managers ready to deal with the challenges of complex systems.

Students study complex systems such as enterprises, their services for different stakeholders (customers/patients/citizens/other organisations and stakeholders), and their internal processes conducted by people (with knowledge, skills and social capital) using data, information and IT-enabled services. The Business component provides students with the knowledge, competencies and values necessary for fulfilling an effective career in business.

Bachelor of Information Systems Bachelor of Business (BIS BBus) graduates are highly sought after in meeting the job demands of the increasingly digital world of the future.

BIS BBus graduates work in, and create value from the financial, environmental and social aspects of any type of organisation.

With future-focussed specialisations including Systems Analytics, Smart Infrastructure and Sustainable Enterprises, BIS/BBus graduates are well positioned to serve Australian local, as well as international job markets.';

$ecoDesc = 'The Bachelor of Economics offers students the analytical and quantitative skills required for an in-depth understanding of key economic principles. The degree complements this knowledge with the option of majors across selected business disciplines.

The course includes training in econometrics, macroeconomics and microeconomics with an emphasis on practical policy. A capstone subject synthesises knowledge from game theory, experimental economics and industrial organisation to study policy-making in real-world settings.';
