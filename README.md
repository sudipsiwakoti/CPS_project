# Course Planning System

This system provides users, typically university students, with the capability to develop a timetable for their subjects for preparation and the reduction of stress in their university career. As such, the software allows users to login with their associated student identification number and view information about the various existing courses and subjects that include its requirements, prerequisites, antirequisites, availability, description/scope and etc. This information will be derived from the related logic and requirements of the userâ€™s university.

This Laravel web application will provide these features in a manner that is user-friendly and delivers an outstanding user experience.
